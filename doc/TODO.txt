[1. March] w/ Carlos

Image uploading is currently done through ADragonFly/.../cloud/functions/UploadImage
Starting Eucalyptus instance is done ADragonFly/eucalyptus/services/EucalyptusComputeService

What needs to be done:
	Create a servlet (JobManager) that takes input: ActionID, JobDescription, Data(optional)
	and uses UploadImage / Starting instance functions
	
	This servlet should also store ActionID and the time it took to perform the job.
	When the job has been completed, JobManager sends a notification to the device that
	started this job. After receiving notification, the device sends it's timing data to JobManager
	
	JobDescription == "SendTimeDetails"
	
	JobDescription
	{
		jobClass : "SimpleJob",
		jobDescription: "Job that does nothing for 5 seconds. Pretty simple uh?",
		jobOwnerDevice: "iphone",
		jobIdentifier : "d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e",
	}

iPhone token: 5324075b4c07afa9e2dbe15b74dbda2227a74d5537f0d4af24cc0aecda697f1c

Sample request:
JobManager?jobClass=CalculateSumJob&jobDescription=
{
	"description" : "Job that calculates sum of variable number of integers",
	"ownerDevice" : "iphone",
	"deviceID" : "5324075b4c07afa9e2dbe15b74dbda2227a74d5537f0d4af24cc0aecda697f1c",
	"taskID" : "d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e",
	"parameters" : [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
}

JobManager?jobclass=CalculateSumJob&jobDescription={
"description":"S"
}
JobManager?jobClass=UploadPictureJob&data=""&jobDescription=
{
	"description" : "Job that calculates sum of variable number of integers",
	"ownerDevice" : "iphone",
	"deviceID" : "5324075b4c07afa9e2dbe15b74dbda2227a74d5537f0d4af24cc0aecda697f1c",
	"jobID" : "d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e",
	"parameters" : [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
}

NB: if binary data has to be sent it should be put into multipart request. Parameters should be used fro primitive values

========================
Write servlet to start an instance on EC2
Also a job to upload a picture to bucket
Integrate some SQL driver and implement storing jobID-s w/ timing & results data on server
Iphone specific tasks to do starting EC2 instance and uploading data to a bucket on iPhone
Request results for a task from server (PushNotification should not contain data about job results, just the jobID that has been completed)

========================
07.03.2011
When client app requests status from server (or at any time that server provides a response) it should
contain following info about the job:
taskID = (MD5 used to identify the job)
status = ____
Status should be one of the following values
new, queued, running, paused, error, completed
