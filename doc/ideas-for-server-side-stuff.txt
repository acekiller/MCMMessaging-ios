The basic entities in messaging system would be Client and Message

Client - encapsulates data necessary to identify mobile device running our messaging application

Message - encapsulates the information to be sent to a device. Can have convenience methods to verify and compose the message.

When the application is being run on the phone for the first time, it will need to register itself. This should be done at registerClientForMessaging applet. Applet would need 
1) device type (iPhone/Android)
2) some unique ID specific to a messaging service that the device is able to use. Correct Client object would then be instantiated and stored for later use.


MessageSender would be an interface which the device / messaging service specific classes have to implement
it has required method: .send(Client client, Message message)

MessagingManager would be a singleton that held all available MessageSender implementation instances. When it's method .sendMessage is called, it would choose correct MessageSender and use it to send the message.
