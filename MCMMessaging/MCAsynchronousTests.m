 *	@brief Moves remote data using synchronous communication with MCM and measures times.
 *
 *	Will move data between clouds (or other remote storage resources) and measure following time parameters:
 *		1. total time taken - measured in phone
 *		2. time taken in MCM to complete the task - requested from MCM
 *		3. time for delivering Push Notification - calculated as follows:
 *			1) requests empty task to be performed (time taken == 0)
 *			2) immediately when server responds, marks start time (associated w/ taskID)
 *			3) when push notification arrives, stops timer (associated w/ taskID, difference is the duration)
